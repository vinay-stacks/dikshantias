            The UPSC Civil Services Examination (CSE) stands as one of the most esteemed competitive exams in India, conducted annually by the Union Public Service Commission. It is designed to recruit candidates for prominent government positions, including the IAS, IPS, and IFS. The selection process is highly competitive and consists of three stages: the Preliminary Examination, the Main Examination, and the Personality Test (Interview).

           The Preliminary Examination serves as an initial screening stage, designed to assess a candidate&apos;s fundamental knowledge and cognitive aptitude, helping identify serious contenders for the Mains. The Mains Examination delves deeper, testing an aspirant’s capacity for critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and effective written communication through structured and insightful answers. The final stage, the Interview (Personality Test), evaluates the candidate&apos;s intellectual depth, social awareness, and interpersonal skills — qualities essential for a successful career in the Civil Services.
